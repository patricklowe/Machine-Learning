# Machine-Learning
There are 2 assignments from my Machine Learning Module at University. Both assignments received an A+
## Algorithm Bias
Looking at the bias of labelled data (Supervised Learning) and the impact of having on label in the majority (i.e 30% of data labelled as 'No' and 70% labelled as 'Yes'). How to resolve this using 'OverSampling' or UnderSampling'

## Feature Selection
Using Information Gain, Forward Search Selection, and Backward Elimination to identify the best subset of features to be used in a model. The final graph shows a comparison on both different methods, and the comparison between training data accuracy and test data accuracy
